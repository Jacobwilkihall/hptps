And that kind of act leaves a mark. [Harry touches his scar.] No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Harry: What is it?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dumbledore: Love, Harry. Love. [Pats Harry&#39;s head gently and stands up.] Ah. Bertie Bott&#39;s Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit-flavoured one. And since then, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee. [takes brown bean and eats it.] Mm. Alas! Earwax.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">House Cup Winner</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">[Harry with his arm still bandaged enters a corridor where up on a stairwell balcony, Hermione and Ron are talking. They stop when they see Harry and lean over the railing.]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Harry: All right there, Ron?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ron: All right. You?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Harry: [as he shrugs] All right. Hermione?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hermione: [smiling] Never better.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">[We see the Great Hall full of students eating and talking with each other. There are green and silver banners with the Slytherin symbol above their heads, already indicating the house with the most points. Dumbledore gives a slight nod to Professor McGonagall, who then clinks her spoon to her glass to ask attention from the students. The crowd falls silent. Dumbledore stands up and speaks with his magically magnified voice.]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dumbledore: Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding. And the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. [There is a medium applause from the crowd.] Third place, Hufflepuff with 352 points. [The applause for Hufflepuff is slightly louder than the clapping for Gryffindor.] In second place, Ravenclaw with 426 points. [Applause again, this time with a slight cheer from some students.] And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin house. [A loud roar rises from the Slytherin table, as students stand up and clap for themselves. Hermione scowls with her hand to her cheek; Snape applauds the students of his house]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Draco: Nice one, mate. [sneers at Ron]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin. Well done, Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last-minute points to award. [Some faces at the Gryffindor table rise hopefully.] To Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect while others were in grave peril, 50 points. [Hermione looks surprised, while the other Gryffindor students applaud her.]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Harry: [giving Hermione a pat on the back] Good job. [Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle don&#39;t like what&#39;s happening. Hermione looks at Hagrid, who looks back to her with a proud smile.]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dumbledore: Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years, 50 points. [Ron looks even more surprised than Hermione did and the Gryffindor table is applauding even louder.] And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">[The Gryffindors cheer again, this time even louder than before. Malfoy has a cringing look on his face, while Harry sees a proud, smiling Professor McGonagall at the teacher&#39;s table. Hermione, who has done some quick math, whispers to her fellow students.]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hermione: We&#39;re tied with Slytherin!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">[Now, the Gryffindors look really hopeful, as Dumbledore hasn&#39;t finished talking yet.]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dumbledore: And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom. [Neville can&#39;t believe what he just heard and the Gryffindors that heard Hermione&#39;s whisper are cheering the loudest. Malfoy looks quite uncertain now.] Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of decoration is in order. [He claps and motions his hands towards the Slytherin banners, where they flap heavily, until the banners have changed completely to red and gold with the Gryffindor symbol] Gryffindor wins the House Cup.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">[The Great Hall explodes with applause, not only from the Gryffindors, but also from the Ravenclaws and the Hufflepuffs because they are glad that for the first time in seven years, someone other than Slytherin has won the House Cup. Hagrid can&#39;t help himself to also cheer, and all students except the Slytherins throw their hats in the air, while Malfoy angrily throws his on the table in defeat. The Gryffindors around Harry are all congratulating him, and Harry smiles to Hagrid, who smiles back.]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Not Really Going Home</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">[At Hogsmeade station, students are walking around, getting in the train.]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hagrid: Come on, now.
